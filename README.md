# The Overview of Computer Network
An simple overview of network.

## The security of Network
There is three way to encrypt the data
* public key
* private key
* message digest (md5,sha)- normally we use checksum for authentication

## Addressing
* IPV4
To distribute ip address in 32-bit addressing mechanism
* IPV6
To distribute ip address in 128-bit addressing mechanism

## Transmist Data
TCP/IP is reliable protocol to transmit the data.

### Timer Management
* Keep-alive Timer
The validity of a connection

* Timed-Wait
Each host waits for a Timed-wait time to terminate the connection completely
