# The Overview of Computer Network
A simple overview of network.

## The security of Network
There is three ways to encrypt the data
* public key
* private key
* message digest (md5,sha)- normally we use checksum for authentication

## Addressing
* IPV4

    To distribute ip address in 32-bit addressing mechanism
    
* IPV6

    To distribute ip address in 128-bit addressing mechanism

## Transmist Data
TCP/IP is reliable protocol to transmit the data.

## Timer Management
* Keep-alive Timer

    The validity of a connection.

* Timed-Wait

    Each host waits for a Timed-wait time to terminate the connection completely

## Congestion Control

When large amount of data sent to server which is not capable of handling it, then congestion occurs. TCP control the congestion by means of Window size mechanism.
